# Modeling and Forecasting Time-series Atmospheric COâ‚‚ with Bayesian Methods

This is the final project for my Modern Computational Statistics class. I picked my own mathematical form of model based on the CO2 data and the preliminary visualization given by the professor and tried to optimize it with Bayesian methods. I discussed the preprocessing of data, the likelihood model, the factor graph representing the model, prior distribution, the convergence of the Rstan algorithm, and the prediction of CO2 in 2058. 

A few of the visual outcomes are displayed here as hooks:
